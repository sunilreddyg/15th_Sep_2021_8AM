==============================================================================================
Note:-->
	Because webdriver is a API, We need to configure environment 
	before start automation tests.

Downloads required for webdriver:-->

		1. JDK 1.8   [Java development kit]
		2. Eclipse-IDE [Java development Version]        
		3. WebDriver libraries    [Java language]


		=> In Eclipse place we can also use other IDE's 
			[Intelij, Noteplus, Editplus, Netbeans ---etc]

Note:--> Before JDK and Eclipse download please find system hotspot size 
	[32 or 64 bit].

	Resule is it shows currently installed javaversion and hotspot size


Note:--> Incase your pc have multiple java versions, We must set environment
	variable to use current java version.

Setup environment path:--> [windows 10 OS]

	        ---> Right click on This PC --> Select properties
		---> click on <<advanced system settings>>

	=> Under Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings
	=> choose language [java] and click on download button.
	=> System ask zip format file to download.
	=> Save file into backup drive.
	=> Later we extract zip file. This process give couple of jar files and we add these
		jar files  to  javaproject...
=========================================================================================================
Note:--> After completed required downloads follow configuration..


WebDriver Configuration:-->

1. Create workspace:-->
		=> Workspace store your projects.
		=> Create folder at any drive and name it as "selenium-workspace"
		=> Create sub folder and name it as "Selenium_libraries"
		=> Dump all selenium executable jar files into "selenium libraries" folder


2. Launch eclipse using above wokspace:-->

		=>Double click on Eclipse ICON
		=>Browser workspace and click ok button.
		=>For the first time we recieve welcome banner, Close welcome banner
			to reach workbench..

3. Create java project:-->

		=> Open Eclipse --> File Menu ----> Use New Option --->select project
			--> open java folder ---> Select javaproject --> Enter projectname
			---> click on finish..
		=> After project creation find it under package explorer.
		=> Expand project to watch default architecture of simple java project..


4. Configure selenium libraries to java project:-->
		
		=> By adding these jar files we can design and execute selenium programs
		   under java project..

		=> Under project --> Right click on JRE libraries --> Select build path --> and 				then	
		    configure buildpath 
		=> It opens project properties window along with java libraries.
		=> Click [Add external Jars] button 
		=> And browser all selenium executable libraries..
